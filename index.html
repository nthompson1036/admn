		<h2>History</h2>
		<p> Durham House of Pets (DHP) was founded in 1980 by two brothers, Drake and Josh. Drake and Josh grew up on a farm, which had been passed down through their family for 60 years! Undoubtedly, the love of animals has always been a staple in their family history. As the brothers got older, they wanted to truly embrace their family values and open up a pet store to provide supplies and accessories for everyones favorite furry friend! The first corporate office was opened in 1980 in Central Valley, California. 
		<br>
		<p> They initially only sold food for cats and dogs, but as pets became more popular members of families, they expanded the products they offered in stores. They started incorporating toys for different animals, and also clothes and accessories. As demand for their products increased, they expanded into different stores around the country. They opened a regional office in Chicago in 1985, followed by another office in Boston in 1990. Expanding their locations enabled anyone across the country to have access to the best pet products.
